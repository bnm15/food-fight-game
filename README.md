First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Brenna Milligan

Date started:8-26-15

Date finished: 9-02-15

Hours worked: 12

Resources used: Piazza, Professor Duvall's example_javafx, some StackOverflow

Main class file: I used Professor Duvall's example_javafx project to create the skeleton
of my project, mainly keeping the scene creation and title function. I deleted the parts 
and characters specific to his game.

Data (non Java) files needed: None

How to play the game: The first level involves a main character person with food being "thrown" (scrolling left) randomly. The player 
must stop the flying food by throwing their own food at it. If the player is hit by 
the food 3 times, it is Game Over. If the player can successfully hit 10 food objects, 
they will be taken to the boss level. The boss level involves a wall of 3 kids each with 
3 lives that are simultaneously (but not constantly) throwing food at the player, towards the location of the player. Once 
all 3 kids have been eliminated, the game has been won.
The player starts off with 3 lives, and those lives are replenished to 3 when the boss level is reached.

Keys/Mouse input: Click to start. Up/Down arrow keys to move the player. Spacebar to shoot.

Cheat Keys: Press S for a 10-second shield (immunity). Z completes level 1 for you. X wins the boss level, but only while you are in the boss level.

Known bugs: None.

Extra features: Boss level, visible shield, bullets that aim (using trigonometry (wow!)) at the player, lives counter, score counter.

Impressions/Suggestions: This was a great introductory project to the class. I can see now how it will involve a lot of self-teaching, and I now understand what Professor Duvall means when he says you could spend an hour on a feature or you could spend months adding tons of features.
