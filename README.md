First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Brenna Milligan

Date started:8-26-15

Date finished: 8-28-15

Hours worked: 1.5

Resources used: None

Main class file: I used Professor Duvall's example_javafx project to create the skeleton
of my project, mainly keeping the scene creation and title function. I deleted the parts 
and characters specific to his game.

Data (non Java) files needed: None

How to play the game: The first level involves a main character person seemingly scrolling horizontally forward 
with food being "thrown" (scrolling in the opposite direction) randomly. The player 
must stop the flying food by throwing their own food at it. If the player is hit by 
the food 3 times, it is Game Over. If the player can successfully hit 10 food objects, 
they will be taken to the boss level. The boss level involves a wall of 3 kids each with 
3 lives that are simultaneously (but not constantly) throwing food at the player. Once 
all 3 kids have been eliminated, the game has been won.

Keys/Mouse input: Click to start. Up/Down arrow keys to move the player. Spacebar to shoot.

Cheat Keys: Press s for a 10-second shield (immunity)

Known bugs: None at the moment.

Extra features: Boss level

Impressions/Suggestions: This is a fun introductory project to the class.
