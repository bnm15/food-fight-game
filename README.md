First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Brenna Milligan

Date started:8-26-15

Date finished: 9-03-15

Hours worked: 16

Resources used: Piazza, Professor Duvall's example_javafx, some StackOverflow

Main class file: I used Professor Duvall's example_javafx project to create the skeleton
of my project, mainly keeping the scene creation and title function. I deleted the parts 
and characters specific to his game.

Data (non Java) files needed: None

How to play the game: The first level involves a main character with food being "thrown" (scrolling left) at random heights. The player must stop the flying food by throwing their own food at it. If the player is hit by the food 3 times, it is Game Over. If the player can successfully hit 10 food objects, they are taken to the boss level. The boss level involves a wall of 3 kids, each with 3 lives, that are simultaneously throwing food aimed at the center of the player. Once all 3 kids have been eliminated, the game as been won.
The player starts off with 3 lives, and those lives are replenished to 3 when the boss level is reached.

Keys/Mouse input: Click to start. Up/Down arrow keys to move the player. Space to shoot.

Cheat Keys: Press S for a 10-second shield (immunity). Z completes level 1 for you after the splash screen is exited. X wins the boss level, but only while you are in the boss level.

Known bugs: None.

Extra features: Boss level, visible shield, bullets that aim (using trigonometry (wow!)) at the player, lives counter, score counter.
