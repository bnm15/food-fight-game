Genre:
Scrolling Shooter

Name:
Food Fight!
It's time to do the thing you've always wanted to do...throw food at things

Goal:
The first level involves a main character person seemingly scrolling horizontally forward 
with food being "thrown" (scrolling in the opposite direction) randomly. The player 
must stop the flying food by throwing their own food at it. If the player is hit by 
the food 3 times, it is Game Over. If the player can successfully hit 10 food objects, 
they will be taken to the boss level. The boss level involves a wall of 3 kids each with 
3 lives that are simultaneously (but not constantly) throwing food at the player. Once 
all 3 kids have been eliminated, the game has been won.

Basic Mechanics:
The main player can only scroll up or down. Pressing space will 
allow the player to throw their own food. I will probably add a cheat such as pressing 
S will create a shield around the player for 10 seconds. The player will be caged in by 
the walls.

Levels/Modes:
The regular, original level only involves respawning food scrolling at a fixed speed 
from right to left. Once it is hit by the player's weapon, it is eliminated. The second, 
Boss level is different because it doesn't involve scrolling enemies, but rather a line 
of fixed enemies that have 3 lives each. In addition, these new boss enemies have shooting 
capabilities whereas in the first level, the scrolling food itself is the weapon and they 
cannot shoot.
